My sussy discord bot.

Invite the bot:\
[![Invite - Bot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite-Bot-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=850336994299215892&permissions=3758615616&scope=bot)

It *might* require more permissions than the one above, and it won't tell you that it's missing permissions cuz bad coding, use this if that ever happens:\
[![Invite - Bot as admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite-Bot_as_admin-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=850336994299215892&permissions=8&scope=bot) (or just give the bot admin permission through Discord)
